With most array problems, we know we can brute force this by getting every sub-rectangle, this would happen in $$O(n^2)$$\ntime. Then we have to think, can we improve upon that? Instead of solving each rectangle possible, can we somehow remember values, so we can solve the area of the rectangle at the best possible time instead of each iteration? We know for a single rectangle the area is simple, and we know for rectangles using multiple elements, we will need to extend the current rectangle left, right, or both. To extend it, we know we need the values on either side to be taller or equal height, so if we can track the left boundary, and wait until a time when there is no longer a right boundary, we can then solve the area for that specific height in heights, and not every sub rectangle."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"How can we track all that?

"),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"When the incoming element is smaller than top of the stack, it means the rectangle on top is too tall to extend further right to create a valid rectangle. So this is the best time to solve the area, by taking the width, which will be the position of incoming elements index, minus the index we have for the popped element: $$width = incoming","_","index - popped","_","index$$. Then we can get our height and calculate our area: $$area = width * popped","_","height$$.
